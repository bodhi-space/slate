#Welcome to Bodhi
This documentation is intended for the developer wanting to integrate into the Bodhi PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) by:

* Building applications to the the Bodhi Cloud APIs
* Building mobile/html applications either as standalone html applications or to be part of Bodhi Mobile
* Building a data integration application into your point of sale system to be stored and accessed from our cloud solution

##Pre-requisites 

### Creating a namespace
Contact your HotSchedules [sales-team ](contactcenter@hotschedules.com,) or [Customer Support ](https://www.hotschedules.com/customer-care/) 


### What is a namespace? 
A namespace is your secured storage location of HotSchedulesâ€™ cloud solution for your business.
Your namespace utilizes user profiles that are configured by your namespace administrator for different access levels to access your business data (e.g.stores, inventory, labor, and sales data)

### Creating your namespace 
You need to provide two important details for HotSchedules [sales-team](mailto:ayal.kerenhotschedules.com):

* Name
* Email Address

###Accessing Bodhi Tools

The Bodhi product has a rich set of tools to access your namespace.  Once you have your namespace and administrator's credentials, go to [Bodhi Tools](https://tools.bodhi.space/#/) to use [Bodhi Query](http://docs.bodhi.space/#bodhi-query41) to manage and query your data, Manage your namespace's types and data using [Bodhi Types](http://docs.bodhi.space/#bodhi-types40), or to access to the [Bodhi API Documentation](https://api.bodhi.space/apidocs/index.html).
