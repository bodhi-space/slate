## Getting Started  
To access the HotSchedules IoT Platform Cloud API, you need to login with you user and password which is provided by HotSchedules.  The API docs are available at this location: <a href="https://api.bodhi.space/apidocs/index.html">https://api.bodhi.space/apidocs/index.html</a>.  

If you enter your credentials (username and password) and click Explore, you will see a list of APIs which you can access for your namespace.  The Bodhi Cloud APIs are REST APIs which returns JSON for all responses.  

Each API has examples and an opportunity to _*Try it out!*_.  You can add data using our provided types or create your own type.  NOTE: Should you create your own type, the new type will show up in the API Documentation for your namespace.
