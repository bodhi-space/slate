#### Bodhi Types

##### Introduction
Bodhi.Type is a user interface developed by the Bodhi team to allow customers to view their current datatypes on the cloud. The tool also allows for users to build new types and extend existing types using a user friendly interface that reads and writes to and from the Bodhi Cloud.

Bodhi Types is available to all users to view and interact with their data on a specific namespace

##### Getting started

Bodhi Types is currently available to namespace admins at https://tools.hotschedules.io .

##### Intended Audience

Bodhi.Type is intended to be a complement to the existing Bodhi CLI. It allows users to easily view, edit and create types in their namespace.  

##### Using this tool

After logging in with your Bodhi admin credentials, you should have access to all of the types in your namespace via the left side navigation bar. 

Selecting a type will allow you to inspect the properties of that type.

Users can edit the type by making changes to the types' properties, or adding new properties.

When they have completed their changes, users can click the 'Publish' button, which will then take them to a screen showing a JSON representation of their edits. Users will be notified whether their request succeeds or experiences errors before returning to the Type page.

Users can also create new types by clicking the New Type button on the topbar. 

![Type Creation](../../images/Bodhi.Type_6.png)

This will take them to the type creation page, a blank form where they can add the name of their new type, select whether or not it is an embedded type or an independent type, and create properties for that type. By clicking the Publish button, they can review their proposed new type, and be notified of the success of their request.

Newly created types should be instantly accessibly via the side navigation bar. Users can then edit or delete the type using the Publish or Delete buttons.
