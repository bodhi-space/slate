##Bodhi Profiles

[Bodhi Profiles](https://tools.hotschedules.io/profiles) allows the namespace administrator to manage profiles in their namespace. Profiles are groups of type-based permissions that can be edited and bulk-assigned to users in your namespace.

- Namespace administrators can access all profiles for their users as well as create and maintain their own profiles as needed.
