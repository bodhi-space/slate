#HotSchedules SOAP API Reference
Introduction

HotSchedules provides a Web Services API for client integration. This API can be used to exchange Employee, Labor and Sales information with HotSchedules directly, rather than via file exchange or HSConnect integration. 
This API consists of a set of SOAP web services, implemented using the CXF framework. Calls to these services should be done via serialized data objects. Services will use a UsernameToken security header, which must be explicitly added by the third party before we will accept their web service calls. We will provide each company with a username and password for secure access to the API services.

###Getting Started
This documentation is intended for the developer wanting to integrate into the HotSchedules IoT (Internet of Things) Platform by:
