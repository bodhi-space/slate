#HotSchedules IoT Platform for Developers
Restaurant operators need access to data that helps them work more productively and efficiently. Your job is to deliver it.  The HotSchedules IoT Platform for Developers can help you deliver work more productively and efficiently through a set of software modules that collect data from virtually any source in real-time and then deliver select data that is relevant, timely and actionable.

Whether you work for a restaurant, a software company or for yourself - wherever you are, whatever you do - IoT Platform gives you the power to innovate faster and cheaper than ever before.

###Getting Started
This documentation is intended for the developer wanting to integrate into the HotSchedules IoT (Internet of Things) Platform by:

* Building applications to the the HotSchedules IoT Platform Cloud APIs with access to real-time transactional and analytical data.  
* Building mobile/html applications either as standalone html applications or to be part of Bodhi Mobile.  Build applications for restaurants, anywhere and anytime.
* Building a data integration application into your point of sale system to be stored and accessed from our cloud solution utilizing a single integration point for data collection

The IoT Platform calls accounts *namespace*. A *namespace* is your secured storage location of HotSchedulesâ€™ cloud solution for your business. You namespace is uniquely named based on your organization name. The [HotSchedules IoT Platform Developer Portal](http://developer.bodhi.space/) has an easy sign up process to quickly get started developing your application for the IoT Platform.  In just a few short clicks, your IoT platform application development can begin.

Your namespace utilizes user profiles that are configured by your namespace administrator for different access levels to access your business data (e.g.stores, inventory, labor, and sales data)
