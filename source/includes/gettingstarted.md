##IoT Platform APIServer Overview
The HotSchedules IoT Platform APIServer is a set of secure REST APIs that are used to store your data.  

The foundation for this document is the Mongo DB reference located at [http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/).

Users may be unfamiliar with the REST query syntax. Those familiar with SQL should note that the same types of SQL query operations are possible using the REST API. Users wishing to understand the mapping between SQL queries (SELECT statements) and the Query syntax - should refer to the following document: [http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/sql-comparison/](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/sql-comparison/).
