## Getting Started

HotSchedules Passbook is a mobile application than allows users to access their data on any mobile device.

With HotSchedules Passbook for [IOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bodhi-mobile/id967184526?mt=8) and [Android](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.bodhi.mobile.android) you can access and publish applications accessing sales, labor and metrics data.  HotSchedules Passbook allows hybrid applications to be deployed and immediately live in HotSchedules Passbook.  



### Building Your Mobile Application

With HotSchedules Passbook you can build Native, HTML5 or Hybrid applications.  

- To access the native components, the [HotSchedules IoT Platform Mobile API](http://mobileapi.hotschedules.io) must be used which allows the HotSchedules Passbook mobile application developer build to just one api and deploy a single application that can run on both Android and IOS.  
- HTML5 apps use standard web techologies which have a write-once-run-anywhere approach to mobile development.
- Hybrid apps use both native components and HTML5, using the [Mobile API](http://mobileapi.hotschedules.io) that we provide, you can develop a single hybrid app accessing native components through the api without having to deal with the native components themselves.  These APIs have been fully tested on multiple devices and are certified by HotSchedules. By using the [Mobile API](http://mobileapi.hotschedules.io) you can write-once-run-anywhere for all our supported native components including camera, calendar, geolocation, etc..
