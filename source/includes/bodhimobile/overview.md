# IoT Platform Mobile API

##Overview
The **[HotSchedules IoT Platform Mobile API](http://mobileapi.bodhi.space)** provides application developers access to native device features for use in web applications. These features are typically unavailable in the HTML5 specification, not uniformly supported across all mobile browsers or improve on the orginal HTML5 spec. In some cases new features have been added that combine several device characteristics into one, for example bar code scanning uses camera storage and image recognition.

There is only one API required to deliver applications on Android IOS mobile devices.

The Bodhi Mobile API provides interface to the native features of a mobile device across iOS and Android.
