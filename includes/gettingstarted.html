<p>Restaurant operators need access to data and we are here to help you deliver it.  The HotSchedules IoT Platform can help you work more productively and efficiently through a set of software modules that collect data from virtually any source in real-time and then deliver select data that is relevant, timely and actionable.</p>

<p>Whether you work for a restaurant, a software company or for yourself - wherever you are, whatever you do - The HotSchedules IoT Platform gives you the power to innovate faster and cheaper than ever before.</p>

<h2 id="iot-platform-api-overview">IoT Platform API Overview</h2>

<p>The HotSchedules IoT Platform APIServer is a set of secure REST APIs that are used to store your data.  </p>

<p>The foundation for this document is the Mongo DB reference located at <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/">http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/</a>.</p>

<p>Users may be unfamiliar with the REST query syntax. Those familiar with SQL should note that the same types of SQL query operations are possible using the REST API. Users wishing to understand the mapping between SQL queries (SELECT statements) and the Query syntax - should refer to the following document: <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/sql-comparison/">http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/sql-comparison/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="api-documentation">API Documentation</h2>

<p>This documentation is intended for those wanting to integrate into the HotSchedules IoT (Internet of Things) Platform.</p>

<ul>
<li>By Building applications to the the HotSchedules IoT Platform Cloud APIs with access to real-time transactional and analytical data.<br></li>
<li>By Building a data integration application into your point of sale system to be stored and accessed from our cloud solution utilizing a single integration point for data collection.</li>
</ul>
