<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The IoT Platform product family has command line tools that allow administrators, support team members and developers to interact with the Bodhi Agent, Cloud APIs and Mobile Application tools directly.  These tools allows the user access to information about the tool itself, to make configuration changes and to interact at a more direct level to the products. </p>

<p>The command line tools allow users to customize the products to their environment and specifications.  The tools are designed to be simple commands that save the user time and the need to look up documentation.  Each command line tool has a rich set of help and quick descriptions of each of the commands allowing the user to quickly use the products.  Many of the tools encapsulate complicated curl and json. </p>
